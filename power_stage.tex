\section{Output Stage}
The output stage consists mainly of circuitry to handle the final power
amplification of the amplification, the purpose
is to gain the currents and not the voltage signal.
Because this is a Class AB, this means that two output 
transistors are driving each half of the signal cycle, however
to change this from class B to AB, it requires transistor biasing, so that
cross distortion is avoided.
