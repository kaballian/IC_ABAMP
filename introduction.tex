\section{introduction}
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a Class AB audio power Amplifier, with some general
requirements.\\
From the provided requirements of the project, the below states specifications are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Output power} - This specification is a free choice and will be expanded later
    \item \textbf{Input Resistance} - $ >= 10k\Omega$
    \item \textbf{Output Resistance} - $< 5\Omega$
    \item \textbf{Bandwidth} - bandwidth is specified to be in the human hearing range 20Hz - 20KHz
    \item \textbf{Design Structure} - must be based on a three stage topology, differential pre-amp, 
    voltage amp stage and power amp stage.

\end{itemize}

From these given, overall requirements, our derived specifications are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Output power} - $P_{out}= 200mW $
    \item \textbf{load size} - Giver the output power, the chosen load size is $R_{load} = 16\Omega$
    \item \textbf{Supply contrains} - given power requirements and load size, the supply rails of the Amplifier 
    system is $\pm 15V$
\end{itemize} 

From our on own requirements, it is possible to derive some other specifications about the system.
The output voltage/current RMS 


\begin{align}
        V_{outRMS} = \sqrt{P_{out} \cdot R_{load}}\\
        I_{outRMS} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{out}}{R_{load}}} 
\end{align}

We assume an input signal of $V_{inRMS} = 20mV$, this gives an overall gain of

\begin{align}
    \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \approx 126
\end{align}

To limit the Amplifier to the human hearing range, an lowpass filter is added to limit frequency content above 20KHz\\

\begin{align}
    f_C = 20KHz\\
    C = 470\mu F\\
    X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f \cdot C} = 0.017\Omega
\end{align}
