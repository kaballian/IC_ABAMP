\section{conclusion}
It can then be concluded that the audio amplifier works as intended
and that it mostly satisfies our requirements, set in the specification.
However, we fell short of the gain goal of $\approx = 126$,
we achieved $\approx 87$, the measured signal peak of the output was

\begin{align}
    V_{out}Peak = 1.749V\\
    V_{out}RMS = \frac{1.749V}{\sqrt{2}} = 1.236V_{RMS}
\end{align}

Whereas the input rms is roughly $V_{in}RMS = 0.014V$
this leads to a input to output ratio of 
\begin{align}
    \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \frac{1.236V}{0.014} \approx 87.45
\end{align}

As for power, the output current becomes $\frac{1.236}{16\Omega} = 77.25mA_{RMS}$
which results in $1.749V \cdot 77.25mA = 95.53mW$ of power being drawn, this is
also not close our target of 200.
